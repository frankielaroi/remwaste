# remwaste Skip Selection Redesign

## Approach

1. **Redesign with Stitch by Google**  
   I used Stitch by Google to create a modern, user-friendly redesign for the skip selection interface. This tool allowed for rapid prototyping and visual refinement of the UI/UX.

2. **Design-to-Code Conversion with Bolt**  
   After finalizing the design, I used Bolt to automatically convert the Stitch design into React code. This streamlined the process of translating the visual design into a functional codebase.

3. **Debugging and Refinement**  
   Once the code was generated, I thoroughly debugged the application and made all necessary changes to ensure smooth functionality, responsiveness, and integration with the backend API.

This approach enabled a fast, design-driven workflow while ensuring the final product is robust and production-ready.
